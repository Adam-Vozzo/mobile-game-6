# Project Void

A mobile 3D platformer. Brutalist megastructure inspired by *BLAME!*. Controller feel inspired by *Super Meat Boy*. Accessibility inspired by *Dadish 3D*. You play as the Stray — a small lost robot in a vast machine-built world. Godot 4.x, Android, landscape.

## Status

Current gate: **Gate 0 — Feel Lab**
Last iteration: 2026-05-08 — iter/springarm-floaty (SpringArm3D wall occlusion on camera rig, Floaty controller profile, Floaty added to dev menu)
Test device build: not yet — kickoff authored without a Godot binary; first on-device build is still the top open question
Performance: not yet measured on Nothing Phone 4(a) Pro
Throttle level: normal — 1 iteration since last human direction

If you only read one section, read **Open questions waiting on you** below.

## Open questions waiting on you

Things Claude can't decide alone, or where it's stalled and needs direction. Each is blocking some piece of forward progress.

- [ ] **Open the project in Godot 4.6 and run the on-device first-run checklist in `docs/ANDROID.md`.** This is the only thing that will catch syntax mistakes in any of the hand-authored `.tscn`/`.tres` files. If anything fails, paste the Output panel error and Claude will fix it next iteration.
- [ ] **First feel of Snappy on device.** Once the build runs, hold the phone and play for 60 seconds. Note: does the jump arc feel right? Coyote forgiving enough? Buffer too sticky? Anything you flag goes into iteration 1's tuning pass.
- [ ] **Confirm the auto-merge git workflow is what you want long-term.** Decided already in `docs/DECISIONS.md` for kickoff after your "go ahead and feel free to merge" — flag here only because it's the kind of thing that's easy to forget about until it surprises you.

### Gate 0 — Feel Lab

Goal: one scene, one character controller, fully instrumented and tunable.

- [x] Feel Lab test arena (brutalist primitives, fog, single warm light)
- [x] CharacterBody3D player (the Stray) with Snappy profile
- [x] Coyote, buffer, variable jump, preserved horizontal velocity
- [x] Dev menu skeleton with live tunables
- [x] Spring-arm camera with lookahead and right-drag override, **SpringArm3D wall occlusion** ✓
- [x] Touch input: virtual stick + jump, repositionable _(positions exposed as `@export`s; drag-to-place UI queued)_
- [ ] Android export pipeline verified on test device

### Gate 1 — Vertical Slice

Goal: one full level that proves the game is the game.

- [ ] Brutalist art direction roughed in (style guide approved)
- [ ] One full level (~60–90 s skilled, ~3 min new player), authored under `LEVEL_DESIGN.md` principles
- [ ] Checkpoints, instant respawn, reboot animation
- [ ] Attempt-replay (ghost trails)
- [ ] One enemy archetype
- [ ] One collectible type
- [ ] Win state and results screen
- [ ] At least 2 controller profiles to compare on device

### Gate 2 — Content Spine

Goal: enough levels in one biome to prove the formula scales.

- [ ] 8–12 levels
- [ ] Level-select hub
- [ ] Par-time tracking
- [ ] Title → select → play → results flow

### Gate 3 — Polish & Ship

Goal: store-ready build.

- [ ] Audio pass (music + SFX)
- [ ] Juice pass (every toggleable element evaluated and locked)
- [ ] Settings menu (camera sensitivity, button resize/reposition, accessibility toggles)
- [ ] Save/load
- [ ] Final controller profile chosen and locked
- [ ] Play Store build & listing assets

<!-- ITERATION ENTRIES BELOW — DO NOT REMOVE OLDER ENTRIES -->

### [2026-05-08] — `claude/elegant-lamport-Z9y09` — SpringArm wall occlusion + Floaty profile

- Primary: wrapped `camera_rig.tscn` in a `SpringArm3D` node so the camera sweeps for wall collisions before placing itself — no more geometry clipping in tight spaces. `camera_rig.gd` now positions the spring arm's origin+rotation each frame instead of placing the `Camera3D` directly; `Camera3D` is a child of `SpringArm3D` and gets moved to the corrected arm-tip position by the engine. `look_at` runs after, accepting a one-frame positional lag (imperceptible at 60 fps). Spring margin 0.25 m.
- Side quest: authored `resources/profiles/floaty.tres` (Dadish-leaning — smooth accel 35/(m/s)/s, generous air control 22, gentle gravity 18/30/38, larger coyote 160 ms + buffer 160 ms, hangtime-biased `release_velocity_ratio` 0.55). Added to the dev menu profile dropdown alongside Snappy. The human now has two profiles to compare on first device run.
- Perf: not yet measured — on-device pending.
- Bugs fixed: none — proactive improvement (Gate 1 needs camera occlusion before geometry gets dense).
- New dev-menu: Floaty in the profile dropdown.
- Assets acquired: none.
- Research added: none.
- Needs human attention: see "Open questions waiting on you" — first on-device run is still the gate.
- Next likely focus: on-device smoke test (human action required), then camera params group in dev menu + debug-viz toggles, then Momentum/Assisted profiles.

### [2026-05-08] — `claude/start-project-void-TxIcJ` — kickoff

- Primary: scaffolded the entire Gate 0 surface — folder layout per `CLAUDE.md`, project settings (Mobile renderer, sensor-landscape, ASTC, 60 Hz physics, Jolt 3D, autoloads, input map), Android export preset, docs (PLAN, DECISIONS, JUICE, ASSETS, research INDEX, ANDROID), Feel Lab scene with brutalist primitives + fog + single warm key light + moving platform + four corner pillars for scale, Stray `CharacterBody3D` with the Snappy `ControllerProfile` (coyote 100ms, buffer 120ms, three-band gravity, variable-jump cut, preserved horizontal velocity), dev menu skeleton (profile dropdown + 4 live sliders + juice toggle grid + perf line), camera rig (lookahead, fall pull, drag override, idle recenter), touch overlay (free-floating left stick + right jump button + right-half camera drag, mouse fallback in editor). Everything wired into Feel Lab and runnable from F5.
- Side quest: none (kickoff scope only).
- Perf: not measured — no Godot binary in the kickoff environment; first on-device run is iteration 1's top task.
- Bugs fixed: none (greenfield).
- New dev-menu: profile dropdown, max_speed / jump_velocity / coyote / buffer sliders, six juice checkboxes, fps + frametime + tris + draw-call line.
- Assets acquired: none (placeholders only).
- Research added: `docs/research/INDEX.md` seeded with sections + suggested reads from `CLAUDE.md`.
- Needs human attention: see "Open questions waiting on you."
- Next likely focus: open in Godot 4.6, fix any import errors, run the device checklist in `docs/ANDROID.md`, capture first frametime on Nothing Phone 4(a) Pro, then begin Snappy tuning based on first-feel feedback.

## How to run the current build

In editor: open `project.godot` in Godot 4.x, F5.
On device: see `docs/ANDROID.md` — keystore must be set up locally first.
Dev menu: 3-finger tap on device, F1 in editor.
Feel Lab: open `scenes/levels/feel_lab.tscn` and run.
