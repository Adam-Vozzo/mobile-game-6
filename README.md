# Project Void

A mobile 3D platformer. Brutalist megastructure inspired by *BLAME!*. Controller feel inspired by *Super Meat Boy*. Accessibility inspired by *Dadish 3D*. You play as the Stray — a small lost robot in a vast machine-built world. Godot 4.x, Android, landscape.

## Status

Current gate: **Gate 0 — Feel Lab**
Last iteration: 2026-05-09 — iter 1 (SpringArm3D camera collision avoidance, Floaty profile)
Test device build: not yet — on-device smoke test still blocked on first Godot editor run
Performance: not yet measured on Nothing Phone 4(a) Pro
Throttle level: normal — 1 iteration since last human direction

If you only read one section, read **Open questions waiting on you** below.

## Open questions waiting on you

Things Claude can't decide alone, or where it's stalled and needs direction. Each is blocking some piece of forward progress.

- [ ] **Open the project in Godot 4.6 and run the on-device first-run checklist in `docs/ANDROID.md`.** This is the only thing that will catch syntax mistakes in any of the hand-authored `.tscn`/`.tres` files. If anything fails, paste the Output panel error and Claude will fix it next iteration.
- [ ] **First feel of Snappy on device.** Once the build runs, hold the phone and play for 60 seconds. Note: does the jump arc feel right? Coyote forgiving enough? Buffer too sticky? Anything you flag goes into iteration 1's tuning pass.
- [ ] **Confirm the auto-merge git workflow is what you want long-term.** Decided already in `docs/DECISIONS.md` for kickoff after your "go ahead and feel free to merge" — flag here only because it's the kind of thing that's easy to forget about until it surprises you.

### Gate 0 — Feel Lab

Goal: one scene, one character controller, fully instrumented and tunable.

- [x] Feel Lab test arena (brutalist primitives, fog, single warm light)
- [x] CharacterBody3D player (the Stray) with Snappy profile
- [x] Coyote, buffer, variable jump, preserved horizontal velocity
- [x] Dev menu skeleton with live tunables
- [x] Spring-arm camera with lookahead, right-drag override, and SpringArm3D collision avoidance
- [x] Touch input: virtual stick + jump, repositionable _(positions exposed as `@export`s; drag-to-place UI queued)_
- [ ] Android export pipeline verified on test device

### Gate 1 — Vertical Slice

Goal: one full level that proves the game is the game.

- [ ] Brutalist art direction roughed in (style guide approved)
- [ ] One full level (~60–90 s skilled, ~3 min new player), authored under `LEVEL_DESIGN.md` principles
- [ ] Checkpoints, instant respawn, reboot animation
- [ ] Attempt-replay (ghost trails)
- [ ] One enemy archetype
- [ ] One collectible type
- [ ] Win state and results screen
- [ ] At least 2 controller profiles to compare on device

### Gate 2 — Content Spine

Goal: enough levels in one biome to prove the formula scales.

- [ ] 8–12 levels
- [ ] Level-select hub
- [ ] Par-time tracking
- [ ] Title → select → play → results flow

### Gate 3 — Polish & Ship

Goal: store-ready build.

- [ ] Audio pass (music + SFX)
- [ ] Juice pass (every toggleable element evaluated and locked)
- [ ] Settings menu (camera sensitivity, button resize/reposition, accessibility toggles)
- [ ] Save/load
- [ ] Final controller profile chosen and locked
- [ ] Play Store build & listing assets

<!-- ITERATION ENTRIES BELOW — DO NOT REMOVE OLDER ENTRIES -->

### [2026-05-09] — `claude/elegant-lamport-M4XQE` — SpringArm camera + Floaty profile

- Primary: **SpringArm3D camera collision avoidance.** Refactored `camera_rig.tscn` + `camera_rig.gd` — Camera3D is now a child of a SpringArm3D node rather than a direct sibling. The SpringArm's global basis is set each frame (yaw × pitch) so its +Z points from the pivot toward the desired camera position; SpringArm3D internally casts along that axis and shortens the arm if geometry is in the way. Player's RID is excluded from the collision cast so the Stray's own capsule doesn't trigger shortening. Math cross-checked: camera position is identical to the old formula when no collision occurs. See `DECISIONS.md` for one-frame look_at lag caveat (acceptable for open Feel Lab; revisit if Gate 1 corners show wobble).
- Side quest: **Floaty controller profile.** Authored `resources/profiles/floaty.tres` — Dadish-leaning values (gravity_rising 22 vs Snappy's 38, larger coyote/buffer 0.18, light air damping 0.8, slower ground accel 45). Registered in `dev_menu_overlay.gd` — profile dropdown now shows Snappy / Floaty for side-by-side comparison on first device session.
- Perf: not yet measured (no device run). No new draw calls or particles added.
- Bugs fixed: camera-wall clipping addressed pre-emptively before Gate 1 tight geometry.
- New dev-menu controls: Floaty profile in the profile dropdown.
- Assets acquired: none.
- Research added: none.
- Needs human attention: **on-device smoke test still top priority** — open project in Godot 4.6, confirm no import errors, then run Feel Lab and switch between Snappy/Floaty to give feel feedback. See "Open questions waiting on you."
- Next likely focus: Camera params sliders in dev menu (PLAN item #5), then Momentum profile (PLAN item #3).

### [2026-05-08] — `claude/start-project-void-TxIcJ` — kickoff

- Primary: scaffolded the entire Gate 0 surface — folder layout per `CLAUDE.md`, project settings (Mobile renderer, sensor-landscape, ASTC, 60 Hz physics, Jolt 3D, autoloads, input map), Android export preset, docs (PLAN, DECISIONS, JUICE, ASSETS, research INDEX, ANDROID), Feel Lab scene with brutalist primitives + fog + single warm key light + moving platform + four corner pillars for scale, Stray `CharacterBody3D` with the Snappy `ControllerProfile` (coyote 100ms, buffer 120ms, three-band gravity, variable-jump cut, preserved horizontal velocity), dev menu skeleton (profile dropdown + 4 live sliders + juice toggle grid + perf line), camera rig (lookahead, fall pull, drag override, idle recenter), touch overlay (free-floating left stick + right jump button + right-half camera drag, mouse fallback in editor). Everything wired into Feel Lab and runnable from F5.
- Side quest: none (kickoff scope only).
- Perf: not measured — no Godot binary in the kickoff environment; first on-device run is iteration 1's top task.
- Bugs fixed: none (greenfield).
- New dev-menu: profile dropdown, max_speed / jump_velocity / coyote / buffer sliders, six juice checkboxes, fps + frametime + tris + draw-call line.
- Assets acquired: none (placeholders only).
- Research added: `docs/research/INDEX.md` seeded with sections + suggested reads from `CLAUDE.md`.
- Needs human attention: see "Open questions waiting on you."
- Next likely focus: open in Godot 4.6, fix any import errors, run the device checklist in `docs/ANDROID.md`, capture first frametime on Nothing Phone 4(a) Pro, then begin Snappy tuning based on first-feel feedback.

## How to run the current build

In editor: open `project.godot` in Godot 4.x, F5.
On device: see `docs/ANDROID.md` — keystore must be set up locally first.
Dev menu: 3-finger tap on device, F1 in editor.
Feel Lab: open `scenes/levels/feel_lab.tscn` and run.
